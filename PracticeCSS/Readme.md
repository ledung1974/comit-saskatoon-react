A basic website layout is divided into many <div>
And the, we can use CSS layout as follows:
   "display:inline;"
   "display: inline-block;"
      
   "display:block;"
   "float:left;"
   "float:right;"
   
    to arrange <div> in a Website

(New method to arrange <div> is "display:flex" in another practice)
